# mental-health-after-COVID-19
Analysis pipeline of the study 'Mental Heath after COVID-19 in Tyrol', which can be executed by running the 'exec_all.R' script.

The repository contains the complete set of scripts used for analysis and visualization of the study data. Since this is a running multi-disciplinary and multi-center project, the .sav files containing the survey answers will be made available only on a serious personal request to the corresponding author (Prog. Judith LÃ¶ffler-Ragg, judith.loeffler@i-med.ac.at) or after the study completion.
